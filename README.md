# Sudoku solver

This is a simple sudoku solver written in Python. The solutions are found via
backtracking.

To generate an unsolved sudoku board: `python3 generate.py`
To run the unit tests: `pytest`

**Includes:**
* Typed Python (PEP 484)!
* A sudoku generator (uses the solver internally)
* Unit tests (very basic and minimal, just on the main function)
* Gitlab CI support for running tests
* Github Actions for running tests
